A mammalian inferior colliculus model for sound source separation using interaural time differences

by Christian Leibold and Sebastian Gro√ü


To run the code, 
1) copy all sound files from the zip archives into a directory "sounds"
   mkdir sounds; unzip puretones.zip -d sounds; unzip originalsounds.zip -d sounds
   
2) create an empty directory "mkdir pkl" to store the model outputs
